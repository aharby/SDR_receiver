A. Transmitter Specifications

   The three mystery signals are generated with the M6 transmitter
   standard in m6params.m, described in SRD, Chap 15, with the 
   following RF parameters:

   mysteryA:  SRRCLength:     8
              SRRCrolloff:    0.1
              T_t:            8e-6 s
              f_if:           1.7 MHz
              f_s:            800 kHz 

   mysteryB:  SRRCLength:     4
              SRRCrolloff:    0.3
              T_t:            10.2e-6 s
              f_if:           1.95 MHz
              f_s:            700 kHz

   mysteryC:  SRRCLength:     3
              SRRCrolloff:    0.5
              T_t:            8.3e-6 s
              f_if:           2.45 MHz
              f_s:            750 kHz


B. Deliverables due January 28, 2021

  1. Executable receiver code and recovered mysteries

  2. Project report (pdf)

    a. Describe your SRD implementation concisely.

    b. Give technical reasons for each design choice in your radio.

    c. If you work with a project partner, identify the contributions
       of each partner.

  3. Presentation slides (pdf)
    

C. Webex presentation on January 29, 2021

  1. Make sure (test) in advance that your audio and video work
     for each project partner, and you can share all contents
     you wish to present.

  2. Each project partner presents their individual project
     contributions.

  3. Time: 15 min + Q&A


D. Plagiarism

  1. Do not plagiarize.  Protect yourself and your fellow students
     from plagiarizing by not releasing your own project work.

  2. Plagiarism will be reported as attempt of deception
     for each of the involved students.
